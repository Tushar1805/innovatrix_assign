# GraphQL and Riverpod Demonstration

It is a flutter test project to demonstrate my flutter skills. Here users can sign up and login themselves using email and password. It uses the ISAR database

Riverpod is used for the state management and ISAR is used as the database. It also has the connection with GraphQL url which shows the data about the countries.
